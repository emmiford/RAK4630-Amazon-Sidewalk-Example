# TASK-013: OTA field reliability testing across RF conditions

**Status**: DEFERRED (2026-02-13)
**Branch**: —

## Summary
Test plan written at `ai/memory-bank/tasks/ota-field-test-results.md`. Deprioritized to P4 — LoRa RF reliability at range is a Sidewalk/AWS platform concern, not solvable at the application layer. We verify OTA works in lab; Sidewalk's link-layer retries handle the rest. Execution requires multiple physical field test sessions.

## Deliverables
- `ai/memory-bank/tasks/ota-field-test-results.md` (plan written, execution pending)
