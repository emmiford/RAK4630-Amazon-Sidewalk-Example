# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the RAK Sidewalk EVSE Monitor project.

ADRs record significant architectural decisions — the context, the decision, the consequences, and the alternatives considered. They are immutable once accepted (superseded by new ADRs, not edited).

## Format

Each ADR follows this template:

```
# ADR-NNN: Title

## Status
Accepted | Superseded by ADR-XXX | Deprecated

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other approaches were evaluated?
```
